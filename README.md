Simple bot for [nineman](https://github.com/UsAndRufus/nineman), implemented as a greedy score-taker, i.e. will take the first available move that increases its score.

Doesn't implement "negative" greedy, i.e. will not block mills or take pieces so opponent can't mill. But it beats a random player just fine.

Depends on `v0.3.1` of nineman.
